      "General: Xypex Admix is added to the concrete at the time of batching.  It is important to obtain a homogeneous mixture of \n",
      "Xypex Admix with the concrete. Do not add dry Admix powder directly to wet mixed concrete as this could cause clumping and \n",
      "thorough dispersion may not occur.   \n",

      "1. Addition to Coarse Aggregate Belt: Add Xypex Admix powder directly to the course aggregate conveyor belt manually or \n",
      "through computer controlled mass batching system.  Account for worker health and safety issues relating to moving belts and \n",

      "2. Addition to Ready Mixed Truck at Plant: Add Xypex Admix in bulk powder or soluble bag form to the drum of the ready-\n",
      "mix truck immediately prior to driving the truck under the batch plant. Then add the balance of the materials or the premixed \n",
      "concrete in accordance with standard concrete batching practices.  Take measures to ensure that soluble bags are dispersed \n",
      "properly.  Such measures can include: a) adding the bags as far forward in the drum as possible, b) adding a small amount of \n",
      "batch water along with the bags, and c) spinning the drum prior to adding remaining components. Avoid delays in adding \n",
      "other components and utilize high speed mixing to ensure homogeneity of mix. Where there may be insufficient water for \n",
      "thorough dispersion of the bulk powder, mix the Admix powder with water to form a slurry and add to the truck mixer drum \n",
      "prior to batching.  Account for added water in the mix design and slump. \n",
