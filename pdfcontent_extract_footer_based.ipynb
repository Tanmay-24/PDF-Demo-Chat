      " \n",
      "A. Install in accordance with manufacturer's instr uctions. Installation requirements vary for each \n",

      " \n",
      "B. GRID LAYOUT AND ELEVATIONS:  \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Once the starting po int and the finished elevation of the deck surface have been \n",
      "determined, the “Top of Pedestal Elevation” (finished elevation less decking paver or tile thickness) is established and marked around the perimeter using a transit water level or laser leveling  device.  \n",

      "two (2) lines that are perpendicular to each other across the deck area. Continue to mark a \n",
      "grid of lines in both directions marking the location of each pedestal. Use the control \n",
      "lines as references to periodically check and assure a square layout during  installation.  \n",
      "3. Next, a pedestal must be placed where each measured grid  line meets the perimeter. \n",
      "Remove two (2) spacer tabs in line with one another atop each pedestal system  placed \n",
      "around the perimeter. Remove all four (4) spacer tabs at  corners.  \n",
      "4. Adjust each pedestal height to the “Top of Pedestal Elevation” marked on the perimeter. \n",
      "Position the pedestal as close to the edge of the perimeter as possible, with the two \n",
      "remaining spacer tabs aligned with the grid line. Using the elevation marked on the \n",
      "perimeter, stretch a mason’s line along and slightly ahead of the second row  of pedestals. \n",
      "A laser leveling device may also be used for this purpose. \n",
      "5. On larger decks, it is recommended that Tile Tech Pedestal System be pre- assembled and \n",
      "pre-set to the proper elevation and placed in position prior to the installation of decking \n",

      "6. As the pedestals located along the grid lines are loaded with pavers or tiles, fine vertical \n",

      "8. Slight ir regularities in decking paver or tile thickness can be compensated for by using \n",
      "one (1) to two (2) shim segments. Place on top of the pedestal, under the corner(s) of the decking paver or tile. Use no more than two (2) shims on top of the pedestal and alwa ys \n",

      "the following:  \n",
      "a. Rotate and stack one cap in relation to another to change slope and add height. \n",
