Section 07542 
TPO Roofing 
 
Section 07542 Page 7 of 8 and weather restrictions. 
 
B. Position sheets to accommodat e contours of the roof deck and  shingle splices to avoid 
bucking water. 
 
3.02 VAPOR RETARDERS 
A. In the generally temperate clim ate of the United States, dur ing the winter months, water 
vapor flows upward from a heated, more humid interior toward a colder, drier exterior. 
Vapor retarders are more commonly required in northern climates  than in southern 
regions, where downward vapor pressure may be expected and the roofing membrane 
itself becomes the vapor retarder. 
 
B. On cold storage/fr eezer facilities, the perimeter details mu st be selected to provide an air 
seal and prevent outside air from infiltrating and condensing w ithin the roofing assembly. 
 
C. Consult the latest publicati ons by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating 
and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.) and NRCA (National Roofin g Contractors 
Association) for specific information. 
 
D. For metal decks, VapAir Seal  MD Air and Vapor Barrier is spe cifically designed for direct 
application to fluted steel decks. It may also be used in conju nction with either Carlisle’s 
CAV-GRIP on vertical wall surfac es, such as structural concrete , gypsum, Securock, 
DensDeck Prime and plywood substrates. 
 
E. VapAir Seal MD Installation: 
1. Surface Preparation: The surface shall have a smooth finish and be free of voids, 
spalled areas, sharp protrusions, loose aggregate, laitance and  form release 
agents. In the event of rain, con crete must be allowed to dry b efore primer is 
applied. 
2. Primer: Surfaces to receive VapAir Seal MD Air and Vapor Bar rier must be clean 
and dry. Prime with CCW 702 or 702LV or Cav-Grip III  Primer. Apply Primer by 
spray, brush or with a long nap roller at the applicable covera ge rate noted 
above. At 75  F allow primer to dry 1 hour minimum. Primer has a satisfactor y 
cure when it will not transfer when touched. Prime only areas t o be waterproofed 
the same day. Re-prime if area becomes dirty. 
 3.03 INSULATION PLACEMENT AND ATTACHMENT 
A. Install insulation or membrane underlayment over the substra te with boards butted tightly 
together with no joints or gaps greater than 1/4 inch. Stagger joints horizontally and 
vertically if multiple layers are provided. 
 
B. Secure insulation to the subs trate with the required mechani cal fasteners. 
 
3.04 MEMBRANE PLACEM ENT AND ATTACHMENT 
A. Position Sure-Weld membrane o ver the acceptable substrate. F old membrane sheet 
back onto itself so half the undersi de of the membrane is expos ed. 
 
B. Apply Bonding Adhesive in accordance with the manufacturer's  published instructions, to 
the exposed underside of the membrane and the corresponding sub strate area. Do not 
apply Bonding Adhesive along the splice edge of the membrane to  be hot air welded over 
the adjoining sheet. Allow the adhesive to dry until it is tack y but will not string or stick to 
a dry finger touch. 
1. Roll the coated membrane into the coated substrate while avo iding wrinkles. 
Brush down the bonded section of the membrane sheet immediately  after rolling 
the membrane into the adhesive with a soft bristle push broom t o achieve 
maximum contact. Division Seven – Thermal & Moisture Protection 
Section 07542 
TPO Roofing 
 
Section 07542 Page 8 of 8 2. Fold back the unbonded half of t he sheet and repeat the bond ing procedures. 
 
C. Position adjoining sheets to a llow a minimum overlap of 2 in ches to provide a minimum 1-
1/2” hot air weld. 
 
D. Continue to install adjoining membrane sheets in the same ma nner, overlapping edges a 
minimum of 2 inches and complete the bonding procedures as stat ed previously. 
 3.05 MEMBRANE HOT AI R WELDING PROCEDURES 
A. Hot air weld the Sure-Weld membrane using an Automatic Hot A ir Welding Machine or 
Hot Air Hand Welder in accordance with the manufacturer's speci fications. At all splice 
intersections, roll the seam with a silicone roller immediately  after welder crossed the 
membrane step-off to ensure a co ntinuous hot air welded seam.  
 
B. Probe all seams once the hot air welds have thoroughly coole d (approximately 30 
minutes). 
 
C. Repair all seam deficiencies the same day they are discovere d. 
 
D. Apply Cut Edge Sealant on all cut edges of reinforced membra ne (where the scrim 
reinforcement is exposed) after seam probing is complete. Cut E dge Sealant is not 
required on vertical splices. 
 3.06 FLASHING 
A. Flashing of parapets, curbs, expansion joints and other part s of the roof must be 
performed using Sure-Weld reinforced membrane. Sure-Weld non-re inforced membrane 
can be used for flashing pipe penetrations, Sealant Pockets, an d scuppers, as well as 
inside and outside corners, when t he use of prefabricated acces sories is not feasible. 
 
B. Follow manufacturer's typical flashing procedures for all wa ll, curb, and penetration 
flashing including metal edging/coping and roof drain applicati ons. 
 
3.07 WALKWAYS 
A. Install walkways at all traffic concentration points (such a s roof hatches, access doors, 
rooftop ladders, etc.) and all locations as identified on the a rchitect's drawing. 
 B. Hot air weld walkway material to the membrane  in accordance with the manufacturer's 
specifications. 
 
3.08 DAILY SEAL 
A. On phased roofing, when the completion of flashings and term inations is not achieved by 
the end of the workday, a daily seal must be performed to tempo r a r i l y  c l o s e  t h e  
membrane to prevent water infiltration. 
 
B. Complete an acceptable membra ne seal in accordance with the manufacturer's 
requirements. 
 
3.09 CLEAN UP 
A. Perform daily clean up to collect all wrappings, empty conta iners, paper, and other debris 
from the project site. Upon completion, all debris must be disp o s e d  o f  i n  a  l e g a l l y  
acceptable manner. 
 
B. Prior to the manufacturer's inspection for warranty, the app licator must perform a pre-
inspection to review all work and to verify all flashing has be en completed as well as the 
application of all caulking.

d. Require that all roof penetrations and walls be in place prior to installing the 
roof.  
e. Establish those areas on the job site that will be designated as work and storage 
areas for roofing operations. 
f. Establish weather and working  temperature conditions to which all parties must 
agree.  
g. Establish acceptable methods of protecting the finished roof if any trades must 
travel across or work on or above any areas of the finished roof.  
 3. The Architect or Construction Manager shall pr epare a written report indicating actions 
taken and decisions made at this pre- roofing conference. This report shall be made a 
part of the project record and copies furnished the General Contractor  and the Owner ’s 
Representative.
